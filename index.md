# Capstone 1: Policy Memo

[Print-friendly version (pdf)](capstone-01_f21.pdf)



## Learning Objectives 

1. Demonstrate understanding of key topics in Unit 1
   a. Defining poverty and considering the "economic lives of the poor"
   b. The role of geography, institutions, and foreign aid in economic growth and the economic well-being of citizens today  
2. Comunicate ideas in a concise format through a policy memo 


## Prompt 

Your assignment is to choose a low- or middle income country (as defined by the [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519)) and write a brief policy "briefing" memo directed at a new program analyst at USAID. 

The following countries are **recommended** because profiles of individual families/households are available through one of the sources below: Bangaldesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Brazil, Burundi , Burkina Faso, Cambodia, China, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Colombia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iran, Indonesia, India, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Liberia, Myanmar, Malawi, Mongolia, Mexico, Mozambique, Nigeria, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Romania, Rwanda, Somalia, Switzerland, South Africa, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam, Zimbabwe



There are **four** key elements your memo should include: 

1. **Economic status:** Description of the economic status of the country based on recent data. You should pull this information form a source such as the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/), [UN Human Development Reports](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/download-data), or other large-scale surveys and data collection efforts ([Demographic and Health Surveys](https://www.dhsprogram.com/), [LSMS](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/lsms/initiatives/lsms-plus), etc.).  This discussion should include the following factors
   1. Current GDP/capita levels and recent trends
   2. At least two indicators that reflect quality of life and recent trends in them 

2. **Institutions:** Description of key events and/or characteristics of the country that has influenced its economic development (that you described above) and a summary of its political and economic institutions. Make sure your discussion is supported w/ evidence. 
   1. You'll need to cite our readings (where relevant) in this section
   2. You will also need to bring in **at least 2 external (non-class) sources**

3. **Foreign aid and effectiveness** Summary of aid this country has received and is currently receiving from [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/) (and/or other places) and discussion of whether this aid has been effective 
   1. Effectiveness can be based on your own impressions, but it should cite other researchers/authors. This could include our class readings, but it also should include **at least 2 external sources**.

4. **Citizen profile:** To help our analyst get a sense of the lives of actual citizens of this country, include a  "pop-out" box that profiles one individual or one family. This information can be drawn from Gapminder's [Dollar Street](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street), [Portfolios of the Poor](http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/portfolios.asp) (applicable for Bangladesh, India, South Africa), [Kenyan Financial Diaries](https://www.fsdkenya.org/), [BFA Global Financial Diaries](https://bfaglobal.com/our-work/financial-diaries/) (China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda)

Then, include a separate page that has the following:

- Definintions of all terms used (GDP/capita, PPP, HDI, etc.)
  - Make sure it's clear in your terms what they mean *exactly*. How is poverty rate defined? Is GDP/captia in PPP dollars, US dollars? Based to what year? 
- References list 
  - Formatted bibliography using [APA, MLA, or Chicago](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/resources.html). 
  - Make sure to include proper citation for any course readings readings *and* data sources as well as external articles/readings.

### Specifications

- 1200-1800 words (excluding references and definitions). You may want to consider bulleted lists, tables, etc. to stay within the word count. 
- Descriptive title (ie. not "TONGA BRIEF")

- Spend some time formatting your brief to make it look nice!  
- You'll need quite a few outside sources. I expect the following: 
  - Data sources for economic profile
  - Academic and non-academic literature for institutions and foreign aid effectiveness
  - Data sources for current aid
  - External source for citizen profile
- When bringing in outside sources, please be concise and avoid large quotation blocks
  - Good: "Botswana's standard of living has enabled the government to invest more in education, a key "engine of economic prosperity" (Acemoglu and Robinson 2009, p77)
  - No: "Inclusive economic instituions pave the way for two other engines of economic prosperity: technology and education." (Acemoglu and Robinson 2009, p77) *Instead, link to your own points and pare down*
  - No: "In their book, *Why Nations Fail,* Acemoglu and Robinson (p77) highlight the importance of technology and education as engines of economic prosperity." *We don't need the book title, and make the link to what you're saying clearer. While we can state their arguments, it's better to integrate them with our own.*
  - No: "Botswana has invested heavily in education, as inclusive economic instituions pave the way for two other engines of economic prosperity: technology and education."  Well, now you've plagarised. Even if you include AR in the references! 

## Deliverables 

### Rough draft (September 20)

**Submit on BB before class by 1:10pm.** 

During class, you'll peer review each other's drafts. 

What counts as "complete enough" for a rough draft: 

- Selected an eligible  country 
- Content in <u>all four</u> key elements
  - Data and indicators in place for part (1) 
  - External sources (2+) brought in for key events/characteristics
- Definition of terms



### Final draft (September 27)

**Submit on BB before class by 1:10pm** 

We will have a remote activity to work with the drafts.
